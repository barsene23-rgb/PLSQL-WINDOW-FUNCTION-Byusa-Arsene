# **Buisiness Scenario**
## *Buisiness context*
### Company type:
- service_based company
### Department
- Analytics Department
### Industrty
- Delivery services industry

## *Data challenges*
The A&B_shopping&delivery_services had a problem because they did not have enough data to track how much products were sold and delivered per region,and which product sold best per region mostly in urban areas. The buisiness also had a problem of tracking who there frequent customers were and this lead to the buisiness missing chances to provide special services to clients. The most common problem was that they had less to no data that would help them track the delivery delays in Suburban areas. The buisiness had also a problem in tracking pending orders.

## *Expected outcome*
- The development of the database will help the buisiness will help tracks the best sales per region whether its suburban areas or urban areas and therefore knowing whether to stock more or whether to focus more sales on one region so as to boost and maximize sales.
- The database will help in identifying the customers with most sales therefore being able to provide discounts maybe like a 15% discount after 10 orders, so as to make them more attracted to the buisiness.
- The database will help in tracking and know the reason behind the delivery delays in suburban areas therefore knowing which kind of solution to apply. Whether its to send more drivers maybe or send more delivery vehicles. This will reduce also the amount of pending orders.
