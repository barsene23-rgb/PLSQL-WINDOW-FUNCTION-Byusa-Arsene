## *Data challenges*
The A&B_shopping&delivery_services had a problem because they did not have enough data to track how much products were sold and delivered per region,and which product sold best per region mostly in urban areas. The buisiness also had a problem of tracking who there frequent customers were and this lead to the buisiness missing chances to provide special services to clients. The most common problem was that they had less to no data that would help them track the delivery delays in Suburban areas. The buisiness had also a problem in tracking pending orders.
